Description:
------------
This project is a simple login system created using Java Swing. 
After successful login, it simulates a hacker-style terminal 
that reacts to user commands.

Purpose:
--------
- For school project requirements
- For learning Java GUI programming
- For entertainment and fun only (no real hacking involved)

How It Works:
-------------
1. User opens the application.
2. Login screen appears.
   - Username: admin
   - Password: 123
3. If login is correct, the hacker terminal window opens.
4. Users can type fake commands like:
   - cd hcdcbreach
   - cd delete
   - Other commands will respond with "Unknown command."
